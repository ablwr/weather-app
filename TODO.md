**TODO for DAY 1: EVENING**

Everyone: Read about geolocation and twilio. Read about whenever gem.

Luke: Explore weather stats and the API further.

Kyle: Separate weather from user.

Ashley: <s>Add bootstrap and integrate whenever gem. Abstract API key out of git using Figaro.</s> Rename heroku and relay login details (pending cool name). <s>Answer twilio API question (string ok for field?)</s> We can manipulate strings wheneva we want!
